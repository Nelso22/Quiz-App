## What does the project do?

For my quiz app, what the project consists of is some beginner level javascript based questions. While taking the quiz, your score will be tracked and compared
to others on the leaderboard after entering your initials. Lastly, the quiz is timed for a total of 50 seconds, but for every question incorrect it will be 10 seconds deducted from the 
total amount of time currently.

## Why is the project useful?

This is a useful project for anyone looking to practice using the local storage API. In addition,  this is the perfect combination for expanding on top of what one may already know.

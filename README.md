# Quiz-App
Come test your coding knowledge with my quiz!

In this project, I have created a quiz app that asks several questions with a countdown timer. Everytime you get a answer correct one point 
is added to your score, otherwise a negative point is added and additional seconds are taken off the clock for each incorrect answer. 

At the end of the project, you will be able to see your score and enter your name and compare your scores to others that have implemented with
local storage. Give it a try and show off your knowledge!
